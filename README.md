# Customer-shopping-behavior-analysis
📊 Data Analytics Project
📝 Overview

This project demonstrates the end-to-end data analytics workflow — from loading and analyzing data in Python, to visualizing insights in Power BI, and presenting findings in a professional report and presentation.
The goal is to explore, clean, and analyze data to uncover meaningful patterns and business insights.

📂 Dataset

Source: Publicly available dataset (or company-provided)

Format: CSV file

Contents: Includes information such as customer details, transactions, and other key performance indicators.

Size: ~10,000 rows and multiple numerical & categorical features

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Tool	Purpose
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)	Data loading, cleaning, and EDA
MySQL Workbench	Running SQL queries and data analysis
Power BI	Dashboard creation and visualization
Gamma App	Presentation creation and storytelling
Excel / CSV	Intermediate data handling and exports
🚀 Steps Followed
1. Data Loading

Imported the dataset using Pandas in Python.

Inspected columns, datatypes, and missing values.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed key statistics and data distributions.

Visualized trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn (histograms, heatmaps, boxplots, etc.).

Identified outliers and correlations among variables.

3. Data Cleaning

Handled missing and duplicate values.

Converted data types where necessary.

Normalized or encoded categorical data for consistency.

4. SQL Analysis

Loaded cleaned data into MySQL Workbench.

Wrote and executed SQL queries to extract insights like:

Top-performing categories

Monthly revenue trends

Customer segmentation and behavior analysis

5. Dashboard Creation (Power BI)

Imported SQL output or cleaned dataset into Power BI.

Designed interactive dashboards with KPIs, slicers, and visuals (bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, etc.).

Highlighted key metrics and business insights.

6. Reporting & Presentation

Summarized insights and results in a written report (PDF/Word).

Created a Gamma Presentation to visually communicate findings, recommendations, and next steps.

📈 Dashboard Highlights

KPI Cards: Total Sales, Profit, Average Order Value

Visuals: Regional sales comparison, product performance trends, customer demographics

Interactive Filters: Date range, category, and region selection

📊 Results & Insights

Identified top-performing products and underperforming regions.

Found a positive correlation between promotional offers and sales growth.

Suggested actionable recommendations for business improvement.
